these repo are not worth using.
they do not fit for purpose on what is achieved, 
random is not going to help with matching algorithm.
deblur there is another repo which works.

Also mentioning Selenium is not the way to do it as automation method.
it uses geckodriver and selenium, with node.js to communicate with tinder api,
very dangerous in sending information that says you are a bot.
also you will just be blocked from logging in.
The method is worth noting that it is somewhat useful if you can turn it to communicate with your own server.

but that is another story.
