This is a compilation of useful backup of existing internet social productivity hacks. (they are not produced by me)
It is to enable rate of success and minimize time spent, since the apps love your activity on them to retain their user base, so if you're not active, your priority in their algorithm might be impacted.
swipe left was blatantly edited to help me to swipe left on everything, at first the original did not work for me, so that is why I found ways to read the .js and also the html layouts in console. It does work at edge for me,although it doesn't filter properly.
bumble vote is a decent script that checks for the votes you have and if people voted for you.
the importance of a good profile matters a lot,impressionism, mine is more of a catfish profile, it has a lot of authenticity in it, but as long as you keep improving, it will be more effective. 

#personal part
I believe in communication more. but shit no one cares about good relationship these days unless it's work relationship(adulting relationship), where is your authenticity, friendship, like c'mon for real you already got a fulfilling spiritual needs? Like stop talking only figures and talk authenticity dude.
it's not that hard actually we just need like a simple reason, im breathing, so lets have fun. Whilst i was travelling I make a lot of friends, and that was the only reason we need to make friends, but it shouldn't be this way like only on vacations. 
Do interactive society for youths and young adults exist?
Do we make friends only from friends? drinks? 
do u make friends from drinking?
i never drink so idk
but i like making friends

I guess outdoor interest does help, and bonding activity like dragonboat, social gyming, and meetup.

then again maybe the natural and unnatural channels are already sufficient, it's in your neglected self that you overthink and made things harder. Social is how humanity works, and this is the culture we get in this generation, people are fast paced. 
It's what you probably need to put into a lot of lifetime efforts if you wanna change that, so you won't do that(for now). You don't wanna be fixing the society to fix your personal psychological needs, it's easier to fix yourself, we just proved it.

but also, we do have the interpersonal ability to connect and once you start helping others, it also helps yourself, you enjoy what friendship yields, you never go back. yeah people can be disappointing sometimes, but the bottle is half full and half empty, look at the bright side.

Expanding channels to know people, can be very useful.

Day1
my profile on bumble is more of a INTJ targetted profile, but also nothing factual. You don't need factual stuff to know people, I believed that. I guess that could be a problem we need to solve after the conversation started, cuz they don't know what you are. so make sure you put in effort to really introduce yourself.
To introduce yourself on the internet, you tell them what you do, you say what is your deal breaker of what they do, and prospects what happens after.

I remember bumble was like already ineffective for match, and also tinder. people lost enthusiasm after it's out for so long. okc surely has some nice algorithm, at the cost of very profiling questions, but I just tried it. You can save images after clicking? that's quite abusive isn't it? Hinge was quite elaborate profile for authenticity, but the ELO of the profiles are not as optimized as the rest. 
If it was not automated, I might only use like 1 channel. But we still haven't got a nice solution to automate it. like predict, no face(pass), filter(undesirable characteristics & words like ig), matching profile, rate profile: pass or cancel. It shouldn't be hard to simulate at all, visualizing is also easy, just need algorithm for face recognition.
I might make this my project.
